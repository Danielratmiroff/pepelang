#### What is Pepelang?
 - Pepelang is an open source programming language supported by me 
 - Easy to learn and get started with (if you know spanish) 
 - Built-in sequential execution (get your concurrency out of here! who needs speed anyways?)
 - Open for PR and improvements!

## Project
Pepelang was born out of two personal desires, 
- Learning how to build my own programming language 
- More programming content available for the spanish speaking community

### Concept
Pepelang is a programming language built and interpreted with/by Go.

It parses the source code in a Read-Eval-Print-Loop (REPL) environment and It has it's own token system, lexer, parser, AST and reuses the gargabe collection system from Go. 

Pepelang's code looks like this:

```var sayHello = fn() { 
   retornar "hello world";
}
sayHello()```
    
> Prints: "hello world"
    
## How to use?

#### Requirements:
- ![Golang](https://go.dev/) installed 

#### Install
Clone the repository into your local machine

`git clone https://github.com/Danielratmiroff/pepelang.git`
 
In the project's main folder, built it by running 

`go build -o .`

Run it with:

`./pepe` 
*or just execute the ".exe" if you're in windows*

**Linux**:

Add `pp` into your variable's path

*.bashrc or .zshrc*

`export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/PATH_TO_PROJECT/pepe`

## Features & Syntax
You can create and run your own pepe programs using the **".pp"** file extension. 

Create a `*.pp` file in any folder. `(e.g. hello.pp)`

Run them with:

`pepe hello.pp` or `./pepe hello.pp`

#### Pepelang supports the following functionality:

- Variables:

Declared with the "var" keyword, can have either a string, number, boolean, array, dictionary or function value


`var hello = "world"`

- Booleans: 

verdad (true) or falso (false)

- Arithmetics supported: 
	- addition (+)
	- substraction (-)
	- multiplication (*)
	- division (/)
	- not operator (!)
	- single operands (++) (--)
	
```
>> 4 + 2
6
```

```
>> !verdad
falso
```

```
>> var foo = 68
>> foo++
69
```

- Arrays:

Indexes are treated as expressions, thus, all of the following are valid:

```
>> var array = ["hello", 2, "world", 4]
>> array[3]
"world"
```

```
>> var array = [6 < 9 , 4 + 2]
>> expArray[1]
6
```
```
>> var array = [!verdad, !falso]
>> array[0]
falso
```

- Dictionaries: 

Keys are literal values and values are parsed as expressions

```
>> var myDic = { "name": "daniel", "age": 69}; 
>> myDic["name"];
daniel 
>> myDic["age"]; 
69 
```

- If/Else statements:

Declared using the si (if) and sino (else), can take any expression value and evaluate the code accordingly

```
>> si ( 1 < 2 ) { retonar verdad }
verdad
```

```
>> si ( 42 == 69 ) { retonar verdad } sino { retornar falso };
falso
```

- Return statements: 

Declared using the retonar keyword (as in previous example)

- Function literals:
	- Declared using the fn keyword
	- Treated as high order functions (supports recursion and callback functions)
	- Can take any number of parameters and such are treated as expressions.
	- Support closure

```
>> var suma = fn(a, b) { a + b; };
>> suma(2, 2)
4
```

```
var sumaTotal = fn(f, x) { 
	 return sumaDos(sumaDos(x)); 
}; 
var sumaDos = fn(x) { 
	return x + 2; 
}; 

sumaTotal(sumaDos, 2); // => 6
```


### Built in functions:

- Len:

returns the length on a given value. Supported by strings, integers and arrays

```
>> len("Hello world")
12
```

```
>> var myArray = [1, 2, 3]
>> len(myArray)
2
```

- Puts: 

Prints a value into the console

```
>> puts("print this message!")
print this message!
```

- First: 

Gets the first element of a given array

- Last:

Gets the last element of a given array

```
>> var myArray = [1, 2, 3]
>> first(myArray)
1
>> last(myArray)
3
```

- Rest:

Removes the first element of a given array

```
>> var myArray = [1, 2, 3]
>> rest(myArray)
[2, 3]
```

- Push: 

Inserts an element at the end of the array

```
>> push(myArray, "42")
[2, 3, "42"]
```
